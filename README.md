Data Bootcamp Week 20 HW Credit Risk Classification

1. Explain the purpose of this analysis:

    - The goal of this analysis is to develop and assess the accuracy of a data model that predicts the creditworthiness of potential borrowers in peer-to-peer lending platforms.

2. Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy score, the precision score, and recall score of the machine learning model.

    - Accuracy score: A prediction of 97% overall of correct predictions made by the model.
    - Precision score: Precision measures the accuracy of positive predictions. 92% of instances predicted as positive were actually positive.
    - Recall score: 97% Measures how well the model identifies all the positive instances in the data.

3. Summarize the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company. If you donâ€™t recommend the model, justify your reasoning.

    - With a prediciton rate of 97% accuaracy I recommend this model to predict the creditworthiness of borrowers. The high accuracy and strong recall for the negative class ensure that the model is robust in correctly identifying non-creditworthy borrowers.
